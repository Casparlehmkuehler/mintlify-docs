## Code Preparation

### Dependencies
Clearly specify your Python dependencies to ensure consistent execution environments:

```python
# requirements.txt
pandas>=1.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
```

### File Paths
Use relative paths to ensure your code works both locally and on the cloud:

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Good: Relative paths
data_path = Path("data/input.csv")
output_path = Path("outputs/results.json")

# Avoid: Absolute paths
# data_path = "/home/user/project/data/input.csv"
```

### Error Handling
Include proper error handling for robust execution:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

try:
    # Your processing code
    result = process_data()
    logger.info("Processing completed successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
    raise
```

## File Management

### Upload Organization
Organize your files logically in cloud storage:
- Group related files in folders
- Use descriptive names
- Clean up temporary files after use

### Data Formats
Choose efficient data formats:
- Use Parquet for large tabular data instead of CSV
- Compress large files when possible
- Consider chunking very large datasets

## Execution Optimization

### Resource Selection
- Start with smaller resource configurations and scale up as needed
- Monitor execution logs to understand resource usage
- Use GPU instances only when your code benefits from GPU acceleration

### Progress Monitoring
Provide feedback during long-running operations:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

for item in tqdm(data, desc="Processing"):
    process_item(item)
```

### Checkpointing
Save intermediate results for long-running processes:

```python
import pickle

# Save checkpoint
with open('checkpoint.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(state, f)

# Resume from checkpoint
with open('checkpoint.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    state = pickle.load(f)
```

## Cost Management

### Efficient Execution
- Combine multiple small tasks into single executions
- Stop executions that are no longer needed
- Monitor your credit usage in the dashboard

### Storage Optimization
- Regularly clean up files you no longer need
- Use the storage API to list and manage files programmatically
- Download only the files you need

## Using the API

### Authentication
Always store credentials securely:

```python
import os

# Use environment variables
api_token = os.environ.get('LYCEUM_API_TOKEN')

# Never hardcode credentials in your code
```

### Error Handling
Handle API responses properly:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.lyceum.technology/api/v2/external/execution/streaming/start',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
    json={'code': code, 'execution_type': 'cpu'}
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    result = response.json()
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```

### Rate Limiting
Respect rate limits when using the API:

```python
import time

def api_call_with_retry(url, headers, data, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        
        if response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limited
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
            time.sleep(wait_time)
            continue
        
        return response
    
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Security

### Data Protection
- Don't include sensitive information in your code
- Use environment variables for API keys and credentials
- Be careful with files containing personal or confidential data

### Access Control
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Use minimal permissions needed
- Monitor API key usage in the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Execution Fails to Start**
- Check your authentication token is valid
- Verify you have sufficient credits
- Ensure your code syntax is correct

**Files Not Found**
- Verify files are uploaded to cloud storage
- Check file paths are correct
- Use the storage API to list available files

**Out of Memory Errors**
- Process data in smaller chunks
- Choose a machine type with more memory
- Optimize your code to use less memory

### Getting Help
- Check execution logs for detailed error messages
- Contact support at info@lyceum.technology
- Review the API documentation for endpoint details
