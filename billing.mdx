## Overview

Lyceum Cloud uses a credit-based billing system where you pay for the computational resources you use. Credits are consumed based on the machine type and duration of your executions.

## How Credits Work

### Credit System
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for actual resource usage
- **Transparent Usage**: Track credit consumption in real-time
- **No Hidden Fees**: Clear pricing visible in your dashboard

### Credit Balance
Monitor your credits through multiple channels:
- **Dashboard**: View balance at [dashboard.lyceum.technology](https://dashboard.lyceum.technology)
- **API**: Check programmatically via `/billing/credits` endpoint
- **VS Code**: See balance in the extension status bar

## Managing Credits

### Viewing Your Balance

Via API:
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.lyceum.technology/api/v2/external/billing/credits \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "available_credits": 125.50,
  "used_credits": 24.50,
  "total_credits_used": 324.50,
  "remaining_credits": 125.50
}
```

### Purchasing Credits

Create a checkout session through the API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.lyceum.technology/api/v2/external/billing/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "credits_amount": 100,
    "success_url": "https://yourapp.com/success",
    "cancel_url": "https://yourapp.com/cancel"
  }'
```

The response includes a Stripe checkout URL:
```json
{
  "checkout_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
  "session_id": "cs_test_..."
}
```

### Payment Methods
- Credit cards via Stripe integration
- Secure payment processing
- Automatic receipt generation

## Usage Tracking

### Execution History
View your execution history and associated costs:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.lyceum.technology/api/v2/external/billing/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -G -d "limit=50" -d "offset=0"
```

### Billing Activities
Get combined view of executions and credit purchases:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.lyceum.technology/api/v2/external/billing/activities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -G -d "limit=10" -d "offset=0"
```

## Cost Optimization

### Best Practices
1. **Choose Appropriate Resources**: Use CPU for general tasks, GPU only when needed
2. **Monitor Usage**: Check execution logs to understand resource consumption
3. **Set Timeouts**: Prevent runaway executions with timeout limits
4. **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple small tasks into single executions

### Resource Selection
```python
# Use auto selection for optimal resource allocation
execution_config = {
    "code": your_code,
    "execution_type": "auto",  # Let platform choose
    "timeout": 300  # Set reasonable timeout
}
```

### Monitoring Costs
Track spending patterns in the dashboard:
- Daily and monthly usage charts
- Cost breakdown by execution type
- Credit consumption trends

## Dashboard Features

### Credit Management
The web dashboard provides comprehensive billing features:
- **Balance Overview**: Current credits and recent usage
- **Purchase History**: All credit transactions
- **Usage Analytics**: Detailed cost breakdowns
- **Payment Methods**: Manage payment options

### Notifications
Configure alerts for:
- Low credit balance warnings
- Unusual usage patterns
- Purchase confirmations

## API Integration

### Programmatic Monitoring
Build credit monitoring into your applications:

```python
import requests

def check_credits(token):
    """Check current credit balance"""
    response = requests.get(
        'https://api.lyceum.technology/api/v2/external/billing/credits',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        print(f"Available credits: {data['available_credits']}")
        
        if data['available_credits'] < 10:
            print("Warning: Low credit balance!")
    
    return response.json()
```

### Webhook Integration
Handle payment events with Stripe webhooks:

```python
# Configure webhook endpoint at /api/v2/external/webhook
# Stripe will send payment completion events

def handle_stripe_webhook(request):
    """Process Stripe webhook events"""
    event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
        request.body, 
        request.headers['Stripe-Signature'],
        webhook_secret
    )
    
    if event.type == 'checkout.session.completed':
        # Credit purchase completed
        session = event.data.object
        # Credits are automatically added to user account
```
