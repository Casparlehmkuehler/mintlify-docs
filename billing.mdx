## Overview

Lyceum Cloud uses a transparent credit-based billing system where you only pay for actual resource usage. Credits are consumed based on the computational resources and time used for your executions.

## Credit System

### How Credits Work
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for actual resource usage
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear per-hour rates for each resource type
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor credit consumption as executions run
- **No Hidden Fees**: What you see is what you pay

### Credit Balance
- **Current Balance**: Available credits for execution
- **Usage Tracking**: Real-time consumption monitoring
- **Low Balance Alerts**: Notifications when credits run low
- **Purchase History**: Complete record of all credit transactions
