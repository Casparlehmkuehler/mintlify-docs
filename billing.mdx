## Cost Optimization

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Smart Resource Selection" icon="cpu">
    ```python
    # Let the platform choose optimal resources
    execution_config = {
        "execution_type": "auto",
        "timeout": 300
    }
    ```
    Use GPU only when needed for ML workloads
  </Card>

  <Card title="Batch Operations" icon="layer-group">
    ```python
    # Combine multiple tasks
    tasks = [task1, task2, task3]
    for task in tasks:
        process(task)
    # Single execution, lower cost
    ```
    Group related operations together
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Timeouts">
    Always set reasonable timeout limits to prevent runaway executions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Usage">
    Regularly check execution logs to understand resource consumption patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Right Resources">
    Use CPU for general tasks, GPU only for parallel computing and ML
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean Up Storage">
    Remove unnecessary files to optimize storage costs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Integration

Handle payment events automatically:

```python
import stripe
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    payload = request.get_data(as_text=True)
    sig_header = request.headers.get('Stripe-Signature')
    
    try:
        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
            payload, sig_header, webhook_secret
        )
        
        if event['type'] == 'checkout.session.completed':
            session = event['data']['object']
            # Credits automatically added to user account
            print(f"Payment completed: {session['id']}")
            
        return '', 200
        
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e), 400
```
